# Notebooks

Jupyter notebooks for step-by-step execution of the project.

## Execution Order

1. `01_data_exploration_landcover.ipynb` - Download dataset and explore data
2. `02_core_implementation.ipynb` - Test all modules independently
3. `03_experiments_training.ipynb` - Run full training experiments

Each notebook is self-contained and can be run sequentially.
